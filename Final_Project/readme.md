REPORT:


Titanic disaster occurred 100 years ago on April 15, 1912, killing about 1500 passengers and crew members. The fateful incident still compel the researchers and analysts to understand what can have led to the survival of some passengers and demise of the others. With the use of machine learning methods and a dataset consisting of 891 rows in the train set and 418 rows in the test set, the research attempts to determine the correlation between factors such as age, sex, passenger class, fare etc. to the chance of survival of the passengers. These factors may or may not have impacted the survival rates of the passengers. In this research paper, various machine learning algorithms namely Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest have been implemented to predict the survival of passengers. In particular, this research work compares the algorithm on the basis of the percentage of accuracy on a test dataset.


Some of the advantages we got of machine learning are:

It enables the machine learning algorithm to train faster.
It reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret.
